This repository is a copy of the original code that only contains the DP code required to compute warping functions between a pair of functions. You should refer to the main repository here for all citations/questions here: https://github.com/jdtuck/fdasrsf_python

This repository exists because I had several issues with installing the entire fdasrsf repo on my local computer.
